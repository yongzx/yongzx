I am currently a rising senior student at [Minerva Schools at KGI](http://minerva.kgi.edu/). My major is computer science, with an emphasis on Data Science, Statistics, and Machine Learning.

My research interests broadly lie in multilinguality, lexical semantics, and low-resource natural language processing. I am also exploring different approaches of representing structural semantic knowledge for various applications such as lexicon expansion and annotation projection.

Recently, I worked with the [Global FrameNet](https://www.globalframenet.org/) team in the summer to research cross-lingual annotation transfer of frame semantics. In the past, I've interned at the [Red Hen Lab](https://www.redhenlab.org/home), [Recruit Co., Ltd.](https://recruit-holdings.com/), [The Interface Financial Group](https://www.interfacefinancial.com/), and Minerva-Masason Foundation Applied AI Research Lab.
